            Understanding the Genetics Behind Obsessive‚ÄìCompulsive Disorder (OCD)
            What is this summary about?
            This summary explains a recent scientific study that looked at the genetic causes of obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder (OCD). The original research was published in Nature Genetics in 2025 and included more than 53,000 people with OCD.

            What is OCD?
            OCD is a mental health condition that affects both children and adults. It causes people to have obsessions (unwanted, repeated thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive behaviors they feel they must do). OCD can be very distressing and affect daily life, relationships, and health.

            Doctors and scientists have long known that OCD can run in families, which suggests that genes play a role. This study aimed to find which specific genes may be involved.

            What did the researchers do?
            The researchers looked at the DNA of over 2 million people, including more than 53,000 with OCD. This is called a genome-wide association study (GWAS). It helps identify small changes in the DNA that may be linked to a specific condition.

            What did they find?
            They found 30 genetic regions that are linked to OCD.

            They also found 25 specific genes that may play a role in causing OCD.

            Many of these genes are active in brain regions linked to behavior and emotion, like the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and striatum.

            The study also showed that genetic risk for OCD overlaps with other mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression, anorexia, and Tourette syndrome.

            Interestingly, some immune system disorders like Crohn‚Äôs disease were less likely to occur in people with genetic risk for OCD, suggesting a complex relationship between mental health and the immune system.

            Why does this matter?
            This study helps us understand that:

            OCD is caused by many small changes in our DNA.

            Some of the same genes involved in OCD also affect other brain-related conditions.

            Knowing which genes are involved could lead to new treatments and help diagnose OCD earlier.

            It also shows that OCD is not just ‚Äúin your head‚Äù‚Äîit has real biological causes.

            What happens next?
            Researchers plan to:

            Study these genes more closely to understand how they affect the brain.

            Look at how rare or unique gene changes might also play a role.

            Include more people from different ethnic backgrounds in future research.

            Explore how this knowledge can lead to personalized medicine‚Äîtreatments that are tailored to a person‚Äôs genetic makeup.

            "Genetics of Obsessive‚ÄìCompulsive Disorder (OCD): Implications for Health Policy and Healthcare Systems
            
            Background
            Obsessive‚ÄìCompulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling mental health condition affecting approximately 1‚Äì3% of the global population. It often emerges early in life, is highly comorbid with other psychiatric disorders, and poses significant individual, societal, and economic burdens. Although OCD is known to have a genetic component, until recently, the biological underpinnings have remained poorly understood.

            A large-scale international study, recently published in Nature Genetics, has marked a major advancement by identifying 30 genetic loci associated with OCD. These findings highlight critical opportunities for the integration of genomic research into public health, mental health policy, and precision psychiatry.

            Key Findings
            30 genome-wide significant loci were identified using data from over 53,000 individuals with OCD and more than 2 million controls, representing the largest genetic study of OCD to date.

            OCD was confirmed to be highly polygenic, with over 11,000 genetic variants contributing to its heritability.

            Several key genes‚Äîsuch as CTNND1, WDR6, and DALRD3‚Äîare biologically linked to brain development and neuronal signaling.

            Genetic overlap was observed between OCD and anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa, Tourette syndrome, and neuroticism.

            An inverse genetic correlation was found with some immune-mediated diseases (e.g., Crohn‚Äôs disease), suggesting possible immunogenetic interactions.

            Relevance to Public and Mental Health Systems
            1. Personalized Mental Healthcare
            These results underscore the biological basis of OCD and its overlap with other psychiatric disorders. This reinforces the need to move toward stratified prevention and treatment models. Genetic findings may support:

            Earlier identification of at-risk individuals

            Tailored therapeutic strategies

            Reduced reliance on trial-and-error pharmacotherapy

            2. Precision Psychiatry Policy
            As with other areas of medicine, psychiatry is now entering an era where biomarker-driven care may soon become a norm. The OCD findings:

            Open up the potential for pharmacogenomic testing

            Support investment in data-driven mental health interventions

            Highlight the value of integrating genomic data into electronic health records and decision-support systems

            3. Shared Etiology and Integrated Care
            The genetic overlaps across disorders strengthen the case for integrated mental health services, where clinicians are trained and supported to address cross-cutting symptoms and conditions, rather than isolated diagnoses.

            4. Health Equity and Genomic Inclusion
            Notably, this study primarily involved participants of European ancestry. For equitable care and policy planning, future research must prioritize diverse populations, ensuring that the benefits of genomics reach all communities.

            Policy Implications
            Investment in Public Health Genomics Infrastructure: National mental health strategies should incorporate genome-based screening and early detection efforts, particularly in youth and high-risk populations.

            Regulatory Frameworks: As genetic testing becomes more prevalent, clear guidelines are needed for the ethical use of genetic information in mental health care, insurance, and employment.

            Workforce Development: Training mental health providers, general practitioners, and public health professionals in genetic literacy is critical.

            Cross-Sector Collaboration: Mental health genomics should be integrated into existing frameworks for digital health, population health surveillance, and behavioral health planning.

            Conclusion
            This study advances our understanding of OCD by uncovering biological pathways and risk factors that may eventually be used for prevention, diagnosis, and targeted treatment. For policymakers and healthcare leaders, it marks an inflection point: to build systems that are genetically informed, ethically grounded, and publicly accountable.

            The integration of genomic research into psychiatric care offers real promise‚Äîbut only if it is met with intentional policy design, infrastructure investment, and a commitment to health equity."

            "# Plain Language Summary: OCD Through Genetics Research

            **First draft submitted:** March 2024; **Accepted for publication:** April 2025; **Published online:** June 2025

            ## What is this article about?

            This is a summary of a research article about the genetics of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The researchers studied the DNA of over 53,000 people with OCD and compared it to over 2 million people without OCD. This was one of the largest studies of its kind. The original research was published in Nature Genetics in 2025.

            OCD is a mental health condition that affects about 1 out of every 100 people. People with OCD have unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and feel they must do certain actions over and over (compulsions). For example, someone might worry constantly about germs and feel they must wash their hands many times a day, even when their hands are clean.

            Scientists have known for a long time that OCD can run in families. This suggested that genes ‚Äì the instructions in our DNA that help determine our traits ‚Äì play a role in who develops OCD. However, until this study, researchers didn't know exactly which genes were involved.

            ## Key Terms

            **Gene:** Genetic material that contains instructions telling the body how to grow and function properly.

            **DNA:** The genetic code found in every cell of your body that makes you unique.

            **Genome-wide association study (GWAS):** A type of research that compares the DNA of many people with a condition to many people without it, looking for differences.

            **Genetic variant:** A change or difference in a gene that might affect how it works.

            **Heritability:** How much of a condition is passed down from parents to children through genes.

            **Neurotransmitter:** Chemical messengers in the brain that help nerve cells communicate.

            ## Who is this article for?

            This article is meant for:
            ‚Ä¢ People with OCD and their family members
            ‚Ä¢ People who think they might have OCD
            ‚Ä¢ Healthcare professionals who treat people with OCD
            ‚Ä¢ Researchers studying mental health conditions
            ‚Ä¢ Anyone interested in understanding how genetics affects mental health

            ## What did the researchers find?

            The researchers made several important discoveries:

            **30 genetic locations linked to OCD:** The scientists found 30 specific places in human DNA where people with OCD had different genetic patterns compared to people without OCD. This was much more than previous studies had found.

            **Many genes work together:** Rather than one or two genes causing OCD, the researchers found that about 11,500 different genetic changes work together to increase someone's risk of developing the condition. This makes OCD what scientists call "polygenic" ‚Äì meaning many genes are involved.

            **Brain connections:** The genetic differences were most important in specific parts of the brain, particularly areas involved in thinking, decision-making, and controlling behavior. This matches what doctors already knew about which brain areas are affected in OCD.

            **Shared with other conditions:** The genetic factors that increase OCD risk also increase the risk for other mental health conditions, especially anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. This helps explain why people with OCD often have these other conditions too.

            ## What does this mean for people with OCD?

            **Better understanding:** This research helps explain why OCD runs in families and why it affects some people more than others.

            **Not your fault:** The findings show that OCD has biological causes rooted in genetics and brain function. It's not caused by personal weakness or poor parenting.

            **Hope for better treatments:** Understanding the genes involved in OCD could lead to new medicines and treatments in the future.

            **Family connections:** If you have OCD, your family members may have a slightly higher chance of developing OCD or related conditions like anxiety or depression.

            ## Important things to remember

            **Genes aren't destiny:** Having genetic risk factors for OCD doesn't mean you will definitely develop the condition. Many people with these genetic changes never develop OCD.

            **Environment matters too:** While genes are important, life experiences, stress, and other environmental factors also play a role in who develops OCD.

            **Current treatments still work:** This research doesn't change the fact that current treatments for OCD, like therapy and medication, are effective for many people.

            ## What comes next?

            Researchers are continuing this work by:
            ‚Ä¢ Studying people from different ethnic backgrounds (this study mainly included people of European ancestry)
            ‚Ä¢ Looking for rare genetic changes that might have bigger effects
            ‚Ä¢ Developing new treatments based on these genetic discoveries
            ‚Ä¢ Understanding how genes and environment work together

            ## Where can I find the original article?

            You can read the original research article, titled "Genome-wide analyses identify 30 loci associated with obsessive‚Äìcompulsive disorder," published for free in the journal Nature Genetics at: [Journal website link would go here]

            ## What conclusions did the researchers draw?

            ‚Ä¢ OCD is influenced by many genes working together, not just one or two genes
            ‚Ä¢ The genetic factors that affect OCD also affect other mental health conditions, which explains why these conditions often occur together
            ‚Ä¢ The genes most important for OCD affect brain areas involved in thinking and behavior control
            ‚Ä¢ This research provides a foundation for developing better treatments in the future
            ‚Ä¢ More research is needed with people from diverse backgrounds to fully understand OCD genetics

            This research represents a major step forward in understanding OCD and offers hope for better treatments in the future, while also helping people understand that OCD is a real medical condition with biological causes."

            "# The Impact of OCD Genetics on Public Health: From Genomic Discovery to Population Health Innovation

            ## Abstract

            **Background**: Public health practice has to date concerned itself with environmental or social determinants of health and disease and has paid scant attention to genomic variations within the population. Recent advances in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) genetics represent a paradigm shift toward genome-based public health approaches for mental health conditions affecting 1-3% of the global population.

            **Methods**: Analysis of the largest OCD genome-wide association study (53,660 cases, 2,044,417 controls) and its implications for public health genomics implementation across healthcare systems.

            **Results**: Thirty genetic risk loci identified, with 6.7% SNP heritability and significant genetic correlations with 65 health phenotypes. The polygenic architecture involves ~11,500 variants contributing to 90% of genetic risk, with highest correlations observed for anxiety (0.70), depression (0.60), and anorexia nervosa (0.52).

            **Conclusions**: OCD genetics research demonstrates the potential for genome-based innovations in public health, requiring systematic translation frameworks for implementation in population health strategies, healthcare delivery, and health policy.

            ## Introduction

            The genomic revolution has fundamentally altered our understanding of disease causation and prevention opportunities. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder exemplifies how genome-based knowledge can transform public health approaches to mental health conditions that impose substantial population health burdens. This analysis examines the translation of OCD genetic discoveries into actionable public health genomics applications.

            ## Genomic Foundations and Population Health Relevance

            ### Disease Burden and Public Health Impact
            - **Population prevalence**: 1-3% globally (approximately 76-228 million individuals worldwide)
            - **Economic burden**: Substantial healthcare utilization, mortality risk, and functional impairment
            - **Comorbidity clustering**: High co-occurrence with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders creates multiplicative population health effects

            ### Genetic Architecture and Public Health Implications
            The transition from monogenic to polygenic understanding of OCD has profound implications for population health genomics:

            **Polygenic Risk Profiling**: With ~11,500 variants contributing to genetic risk, population-level risk stratification becomes feasible through polygenic risk scores (PRS), enabling targeted public health interventions.

            **Shared Genetic Pathways**: Genetic correlations with 65 phenotypes suggest common biological pathways underlying multiple mental health conditions, supporting integrated public health approaches.

            **Heritability Patterns**: 6.7% SNP heritability indicates substantial environmental interaction effects, emphasizing gene-environment interaction frameworks for population health interventions.

            "# üß¨ BREAKTHROUGH: Scientists Unlock the Genetics Behind OCD

            ## üî¨ What Just Happened?
            Researchers just completed the **LARGEST genetic study of OCD ever** - analyzing DNA from over 53,000 people with OCD and 2+ million without it. This research will provide valuable biological insight into the causes of this common mental health condition.

            ## üß† What is OCD?
            **Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder** affects 1 in every 50 people worldwide. Do you know anyone who suffers from unwanted, repetitive thoughts? A friend who can't stop checking locks or washing hands? Or a family member who fights intrusive mental patterns?

            *Odds are you do.* OCD is when your brain gets "stuck" on unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and you feel compelled to do repetitive behaviors (compulsions) to make the anxiety go away.

            ## üéØ Key Discoveries That Matter to YOU:

            ### ‚úÖ **OCD is REAL and BIOLOGICAL**
            * Found 30 specific spots in our DNA linked to OCD
            * Identified around 250 genes connected to the condition
            * It's not "just in your head" - there are actual genetic differences
            * This helps fight stigma around mental health üí™

            ### ‚úÖ **Learn About Yourself and Your Family**
            As research continues, we're moving toward a future where you'll have unique opportunities to learn about your health, behavior, genetic ancestry, and how your family history compares to other study participants.

            "Okay, I will now rewrite the plain language summary for the "OCD Through Genetics" paper, using the AAV-based gene therapy summary as a formatting and style example.

            Here's the new plain language summary for the OCD genetics paper:

            Plain Language Summary of Publication

            A plain language summary of how our genes can influence Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): new discoveries and what they mean.

            Nora I. Strom, Zachary F. Gerring, Marco Galimberti, Dongmei Yu, and many other researchers (a full list of authors appears at the end of the original paper).
            Affiliations of authors vary and can be found in the original paper.
            Original article published in Nature Genetics in 2025 (Note: Placeholder year as per original OCR).

            Summary

            What is this article about?
            This is a summary of a large research study about how our genes (our body's instruction manual) might play a role in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The study looked at the DNA of many thousands of people to find small differences that might be more common in people with OCD. The original scientific paper was published in Nature Genetics.

            OCD is a mental health condition. People with OCD experience:

            Obsessions: Unwanted, intrusive thoughts, images, or urges that cause distress.

            Compulsions: Repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rigid rules. The goal is often to prevent or reduce anxiety or prevent a feared event.

            Genes are instructions that tell our body how to grow and work. Sometimes, small changes or "variations" in these genes can affect how our brain develops or functions, which might contribute to conditions like OCD. This study aimed to find more of these genetic variations linked to OCD.

            How our genes might be linked to OCD:
            This study didn't look at how to treat OCD with gene therapy, but rather at the natural genetic differences that might make someone more or less likely to develop OCD. Understanding these differences can help scientists learn more about the biology of OCD.

            Why is this important?
            Finding genetic links can help us understand:

            The biological causes of OCD.

            Why some people develop OCD and others don't.

            Potentially, in the future, new ways to diagnose or treat OCD.

            This research is important for people with OCD, their families, and healthcare professionals who want to understand more about this complex condition.

            What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)?

            OCD is a condition where people have recurring, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and feel the need to do certain repetitive behaviors (compulsions).

            Obsessions aren't just everyday worries; they are persistent and cause a lot of anxiety. Examples include fears of contamination, doubts about having done something (like locking a door), or needing things to be in perfect order.

            Compulsions are actions someone does to try and reduce the anxiety from obsessions or prevent something bad from happening. Examples include excessive handwashing, repeatedly checking things, or arranging items in a specific way.

            OCD can significantly impact a person's daily life, relationships, and work or school.

            What are genes?
            Genes are like the instruction book for our bodies. They are made of DNA and tell our cells how to grow, develop, and function. We inherit our genes from our parents.

            Genetic Variation: Everyone's genes are slightly different ‚Äì this is why we all look and act differently. These small differences are called genetic variations.

            Genes and Health: Some genetic variations can increase the chance of developing certain health conditions, including mental health conditions like OCD. This doesn't mean that if you have a certain gene variation you will get the condition, but it might make it more likely.

            What did this study find about genes and OCD?

            Researchers looked at the DNA of over 53,000 people with OCD and over 2 million people without OCD. They found:

            30 New Genetic "Hotspots": They identified 30 specific areas in our DNA (called "loci") that seem to be linked to a higher chance of having OCD. This is a big increase from what was known before.

            Many Genes Involved: It's not just one or two "OCD genes." The study suggests that many (perhaps thousands) of small genetic variations, each with a tiny effect, add up to increase a person's risk.

            Brain Connections: Some of the genes found are known to be important for how brain cells (neurons) grow, connect, and send messages to each other, especially in areas of the brain involved in decision-making, learning, and managing emotions (like the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum).

            Immune System Link: Some of the genetic hotspots are in a region of our DNA that controls our immune system. This hints that there might be a connection between how our immune system works and OCD.

            Shared Genetics with Other Conditions:

            People with OCD often have other conditions like anxiety or depression. This study found that OCD shares some genetic links with anxiety, depression, anorexia nervosa, and Tourette syndrome.

            Interestingly, the genetic factors for OCD were less common in people with inflammatory bowel diseases or those with higher educational achievement or body mass index.

            What do these findings mean for people with OCD?

            Better Understanding: This research helps us understand that OCD has real biological roots in our genes and how our brain works. This can help reduce stigma ‚Äì it's not a person's fault or a sign of weakness.

            Future Treatments: By identifying the specific genes and biological pathways involved, scientists might one day be able to develop new and more targeted treatments for OCD. This is a long-term goal, but these discoveries are important first steps.

            Not a Diagnostic Test (Yet): It's important to know that this research doesn't mean we can do a genetic test to diagnose OCD or predict who will definitely get it. The genetic influences are complex and involve many small factors.

            Importance of Continued Research: More research is needed to understand exactly how these genetic variations affect the brain and lead to OCD symptoms.

            Key points of this study and what they mean:

            ‚úì Many new genetic links to OCD were found (30 "hotspots").
            * This means we have more specific clues about the biology of OCD.
            ‚úì OCD is influenced by many genes, each with a small effect.
            * It's not a single "OCD gene" but a complex combination.
            ‚úì Genes involved in brain cell communication and the immune system seem to play a role.
            * This helps scientists focus on specific biological processes.
            ‚úì OCD shares some genetic background with other mental health conditions.
            * This can help us understand why these conditions often occur together.
            ‚úì This research provides hope for future, more targeted treatments.
            * Understanding the cause is the first step to finding better solutions.

            "Okay, I will now rewrite the "Healthcare & Policy Leader Summary" for the "OCD Through Genetics" paper, using the provided "Impact of genetics and genomics on public health" paper as an example for style, tone, and structure.

            Here's the new summary:

            The Impact of Recent Genetic Discoveries on Understanding Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: Implications for Public Health, Policy, and Practice

            Executive Summary:
            Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) presents significant personal and societal burdens. While public health has traditionally focused on environmental and social determinants of health, recent large-scale genomic research is compelling a re-evaluation of the role of genetic variations in complex psychiatric disorders like OCD. A landmark genome-wide association study (GWAS) has identified 30 new genetic loci robustly associated with OCD, significantly expanding our understanding of its biological underpinnings. These findings implicate specific genes involved in neurodevelopment, synaptic function, and immune pathways (notably within the Major Histocompatibility Complex - MHC region), and highlight OCD's polygenic nature. Furthermore, the study reveals a shared genetic architecture with other psychiatric conditions and inverse correlations with certain somatic traits. The integration of this genomic knowledge into public health research, policy, and practice represents a major opportunity and challenge for our healthcare systems, necessitating a strategic approach to translate these findings responsibly for the benefit of population health.

            Key Findings & Their Relevance to Public Health and Policy:

            Expanded Etiological Understanding & Biological Plausibility:

            The identification of 30 new genetic loci and numerous candidate effector genes (including WDR6, DALRD3, CTNND1) provides unprecedented insight into the molecular pathways contributing to OCD. This strengthens the biological basis of the disorder, moving beyond purely psychosocial models.

            Implication: This enhanced understanding can inform the development of more targeted public health messaging, reduce stigma associated with OCD by highlighting its neurobiological underpinnings, and guide future research into preventative and therapeutic strategies.

            Neurobiological and Immunological Pathways Implicated:

            Genetic risk for OCD was significantly associated with excitatory neurons in the hippocampus and cortex, and D‚ÇÅ/D‚ÇÇ type dopamine receptor-containing neurons, validating existing neurocircuitry models of OCD.

            The strong association with the MHC region suggests a potential interplay between immune system function and OCD pathogenesis.

            Implication: These findings can direct public health research towards investigating how these specific brain systems and immune responses contribute to OCD development and progression, potentially identifying novel targets for early intervention or stratified prevention programs.

            Complex Polygenic Architecture & Risk Stratification Challenges:

            OCD is highly polygenic, with an estimated ~11,500 genetic variants contributing to its heritability. Common SNPs explained ~6.7% of variance in the broad population (higher in clinically defined subgroups).

            Implication: While direct genetic screening for OCD risk in the general population is not currently feasible or advisable due to this complexity, this knowledge underscores that OCD risk is distributed across the population. Public health strategies should focus on broad awareness and early symptom recognition, rather than attempting to identify high-risk individuals based on genetics alone at this stage. However, for subgroups with a strong family history or early severe onset, genomic information might eventually play a role in more personalized risk assessment, if ethically and robustly validated.

            Genetic Overlap with Comorbidities & Implications for Integrated Care:

            Significant positive genetic correlations were observed with anxiety disorders, depression, anorexia nervosa, and Tourette syndrome.

            Implication: This genetic overlap supports the clinical observation of high comorbidity and suggests shared etiological pathways. Public health systems and healthcare policy should promote integrated care models that address these co-occurring conditions holistically, rather than in silos. This may improve treatment outcomes and resource utilization.

            Inverse Genetic Correlations & Broader Health Determinants:

            Negative genetic correlations were found with inflammatory bowel diseases, educational attainment, and body mass index.

            Implication: These findings suggest complex, potentially pleiotropic, genetic effects influencing multiple health and social outcomes. Public health research should explore these interconnections to understand how genetic predispositions might interact with social and environmental factors to shape overall population health and health inequalities.

            Challenges and Opportunities for Public Health Systems:

            Translation into Practice: The primary challenge is the responsible and effective translation of this genomic knowledge into public health policy and clinical practice. This requires a strategic, evidence-based approach.

            Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications (ELSI): The integration of genomics raises significant ELSI concerns, including potential for genetic discrimination, stigmatization, and equitable access to any future genomic applications. Public health policy must proactively address these issues through robust ethical frameworks and public engagement.

            Health Literacy & Workforce Development: Enhancing genomic literacy among public health professionals, clinicians, and the general public is crucial for appropriate interpretation and application of this information.

            Data Infrastructure & Research: Public health surveillance systems may need to adapt to incorporate genomic data responsibly. Continued investment in population-based research, including studies on gene-environment interactions, is essential.

            Avoiding Genetic Determinism: It is critical to communicate that genetic findings indicate predispositions, not predestination. Public health messaging must continue to emphasize the importance of modifiable environmental, social, and behavioral factors in mental health.

            Conclusion & Policy Recommendations:

            The recent advancements in understanding the genetic architecture of OCD offer significant opportunities to refine public health approaches to mental illness. However, this potential can only be realized through careful and ethical integration of genomic knowledge.

            Policy leaders should consider:

            Supporting further research: Invest in functional genomics to elucidate the mechanisms by which identified variants contribute to OCD, and in epidemiological studies to understand gene-environment interactions.

            Developing ethical guidelines: Establish clear ethical and legal frameworks for the use of genomic information in mental health contexts, addressing privacy, discrimination, and equitable access.

            Promoting genomic literacy: Implement education and training programs for healthcare professionals and the public on the implications of genomics for health.

            Fostering interdisciplinary collaboration: Encourage dialogue and collaboration between geneticists, public health practitioners, clinicians, ethicists, and patient advocacy groups to guide the responsible translation of these findings.

            Integrating mental health services: Strengthen integrated care models that recognize the comorbidity of OCD with other psychiatric and potentially somatic conditions, informed by shared genetic insights.

            By proactively addressing these challenges and opportunities, the healthcare system can harness the power of genomics to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of OCD, ultimately benefiting population health and reducing the burden of this complex disorder."
