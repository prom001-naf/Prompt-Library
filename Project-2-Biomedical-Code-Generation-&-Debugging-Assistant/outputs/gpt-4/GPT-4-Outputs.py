## Bioinformatics Code Generation Prompts & Outputs

### Prompt 1:

"Write Python code using pandas and scikit-allel to load a VCF file, extract SNP data, and calculate allele frequencies. Return a dataframe with chromosome, position, ref allele, alt allele, and frequency."

### Output:

"Here's a Python script using pandas and scikit-allel to load a VCF file, extract SNP data, and calculate allele frequencies. The final output is a pandas DataFrame with columns: chromosome, position, ref allele, alt allele, and frequency."

# Load the VCF file
#vcf_path = 'your_file.vcf'  # Replace with your actual VCF file path
#callset = allel.read_vcf(vcf_path, fields=['variants/CHROM', 'variants/POS', 
#                                          'variants/REF', 'variants/ALT', 
#                                           'calldata/GT'])

# Extract variant information
#chrom = callset['variants/CHROM']
#pos = callset['variants/POS']
#ref = callset['variants/REF']
#alt = callset['variants/ALT']
#gt = allel.GenotypeArray(callset['calldata/GT'])

# Convert to allele counts
# ac = gt.count_alleles()

# Calculate allele frequencies (frequency of ALT allele)
# alt_freq = ac[:, 1] / ac.sum(axis=1)

# Build the DataFrame
# df = pd.DataFrame({
#    'chromosome': chrom,
#    'position': pos,
#    'ref_allele': ref,
#    'alt_allele': [a[0] if len(a) > 0 else None for a in alt],
#    'frequency': alt_freq
#})

#print(df.head())


### Prompt 2:

"Generate Python code that reads a CSV of gene expression data (rows = genes, columns = samples), performs PCA using scikit-learn, and plots the first two principal components using matplotlib."

### Output:

Here's a Python script that reads a CSV file of gene expression data, performs PCA using scikit-learn, and plots the first two principal components using matplotlib.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load gene expression data from CSV
# Assumes rows are genes and columns are samples
# Use index_col=0 if the first column contains gene names
df = pd.read_csv('gene_expression.csv', index_col=0)

# Transpose the data so that rows = samples, columns = genes
data = df.T

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data)

# Perform PCA
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(scaled_data)

# Create a DataFrame for the principal components
pc_df = pd.DataFrame(data=principal_components, columns=['PC1', 'PC2'])

# Plot the first two principal components
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(pc_df['PC1'], pc_df['PC2'], edgecolor='k', alpha=0.7)
plt.title('PCA of Gene Expression Data')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.grid(True)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Notes:

  Replace 'gene_expression.csv' with the path to your actual CSV file.

  The StandardScaler standardizes the features before PCA (zero mean, unit variance), which is generally recommended.

  If you have labels (e.g., sample types or conditions), you can color the points accordingly. Let me know if you want that included.



## Bioinformatics Pipeline Explainer Prompts & Outputs

### Prompt 1:

"Provide a step-by-step explanation of how RNA-seq differential expression analysis is performed using DESeq2 in R. Use plain language suitable for a health science student."

### Output:

Sure! Here's a step-by-step, plain-language explanation of how RNA-seq differential expression analysis is done using DESeq2 in R, tailored for a health science student without a deep bioinformatics background.

🔬 What is DESeq2 for?
DESeq2 is a tool that helps identify genes that are expressed differently between groups (e.g., patients vs. healthy controls) using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.

📘 Step-by-Step Guide to DESeq2
Step 1: Prepare your data
You need two key things:

A count matrix – a table with:

Genes as rows

Samples (patients, controls, etc.) as columns

Each cell contains a raw read count (how many RNA reads mapped to that gene in that sample)

Sample information (metadata) – a table that describes each sample:

Which group it belongs to (e.g., "control" or "treated")

Any other variables (like age, sex, batch)

Step 2: Load the DESeq2 package
In R, you first load the DESeq2 package:

library(DESeq2)

Step 3: Create a DESeq2 dataset object
You combine the count matrix and sample metadata into a special object:

dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = counts,
                              colData = metadata,
                              design = ~ condition)

  counts is your gene count matrix

  metadata is your sample info

  condition is the grouping variable (e.g., treatment vs. control)

Step 4: Filter low-count genes
Genes with almost no counts across all samples are removed to reduce noise:

dds <- dds[rowSums(counts(dds)) > 10, ]

Step 5: Normalize the data
DESeq2 adjusts for differences in sequencing depth between samples (some samples have more reads than others):

dds <- estimateSizeFactors(dds)

Step 6: Run the differential expression analysis
This step performs the actual statistical test:

dds <- DESeq(dds)

DESeq2 fits a model for each gene and tests whether there's a statistically significant difference between groups.

Step 7: Get the results
You extract the list of differentially expressed genes:

res <- results(dds)

This gives you a table with:

  log2 fold change (how much the gene expression changed)

  p-value (is the change statistically significant?)

  Adjusted p-value (FDR) (controls for multiple testing)

You can sort genes by significance:

resOrdered <- res[order(res$padj), ]

Step 8: Visualize the results
MA plot – shows gene expression changes:

plotMA(res)

  Volcano plot – shows significance vs. change in expression

  Heatmap – shows expression of top genes across all samples

Step 9: Save and interpret the results
You can export the results to a CSV file:

write.csv(as.data.frame(resOrdered), file = "deseq2_results.csv")

Then interpret:

  Which genes are upregulated or downregulated

  Which might be biologically relevant in your condition

✅ Summary
Step	What Happens?
1	Load count data and sample info
2	Create a DESeq2 object
3	Filter low-expressed genes
4	Normalize counts
5	Run differential analysis
6	Get results (fold changes, p-values)
7	Visualize findings
8	Save and interpret significant genes

### Prompt 2:

"Break down the steps of the GATK Best Practices pipeline for variant calling from raw sequencing reads to final VCF, including tools used and data formats involved."

### Output:

🧬 GATK Best Practices Pipeline for Variant Calling
🎯 Goal: Identify high-confidence genetic variants (SNPs and indels) from sequencing data.
🔹 Step 1: Input – Raw sequencing data
Data format: FASTQ (contains raw reads and quality scores)

Tool: Sequencing instrument (e.g., Illumina)

🔹 Step 2: Alignment to reference genome
🔧 Tool: BWA-MEM (or another aligner)
bwa mem reference.fasta sample_R1.fastq sample_R2.fastq > sample.sam
    Input: FASTQ

    Output: SAM (Sequence Alignment Map)

    SAM format is a human-readable alignment file.

🔹 Step 3: Convert and sort alignments
🔧 Tool: SAMtools or Picard
samtools view -Sb sample.sam | samtools sort -o sample_sorted.bam
    Input: SAM

    Output: BAM (Binary Alignment Map), sorted by genomic position

    Then: Index the BAM file
samtools index sample_sorted.bam

🔹 Step 4: Mark duplicates
🔧 Tool: Picard MarkDuplicates
picard MarkDuplicates I=sample_sorted.bam O=dedup.bam M=metrics.txt
    Purpose: Removes duplicate reads from PCR amplification

    Input/Output: BAM

    Also generates duplication metrics

🔹 Step 5: Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR)
🔧 Tool: GATK BaseRecalibrator and ApplyBQSR
Step A – Create recalibration model:
    gatk BaseRecalibrator \
    -I dedup.bam \
    -R reference.fasta \
    --known-sites known_variants.vcf \
    -O recal_data.table
        Purpose: Adjusts quality scores to correct systematic errors from the sequencer

        Input/Output: BAM

🔹 Step 6: Variant Calling
🔧 Tool: GATK HaplotypeCaller
gatk HaplotypeCaller \
  -R reference.fasta \
  -I recalibrated.bam \
  -O raw_variants.g.vcf \
  -ERC GVCF
    Mode: GVCF mode (for joint calling later)

    Output: GVCF – a special VCF that captures all sites (not just variants)

🔹 Step 7: Joint Genotyping (if multiple samples)
🔧 Tools: GATK GenomicsDBImport and GATK GenotypeGVCFs
Step A – Combine GVCFs into a GenomicsDB:
gatk GenomicsDBImport \
  --genomicsdb-workspace-path my_database \
  --sample-name-map sample_map.txt \
  --intervals intervals.list
Step B – Joint Genotyping:
gatk GenotypeGVCFs \
  -R reference.fasta \
  -V gendb://my_database \
  -O raw_variants.vcf
    Output: Raw VCF file containing genotypes for all samples

🔹 Step 8: Variant Filtering
For SNPs:
gatk VariantFiltration \
  #-V raw_variants.vcf \
  #-O filtered_snps.vcf \
  #--filter-expression "QD < 2.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0" \
  #--filter-name "SNP_filter"
For indels:
gatk VariantFiltration \
  -V raw_variants.vcf \
  -O filtered_indels.vcf \
  --filter-expression "QD < 2.0 || FS > 200.0" \
  --filter-name "INDEL_filter"
    #Purpose: Removes low-confidence variants

    #Output: Final filtered VCF

✅ Final Output
    Filtered VCF file: High-quality variants (SNPs/indels)

    Can be used for:

        Genotyping

        Population studies

        Disease association studies

### Prompt 2:

"Diagnose and correct an SQL query returning duplicates from a patient records table when joining to visit logs. The corrected query should return one row per patient with their most recent visit date."

### Output:

To help you diagnose and correct the SQL query, here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what typically causes duplicate rows when joining a patients table to a visits table — and how to fix it so you only get one row per patient with their most recent visit date.

💡 The Problem: Duplicate Rows
Tables:
    patients: one row per patient

    visits: multiple rows per patient (one for each visit)

Bad Query (returns duplicates):
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, v.visit_date
FROM patients p
JOIN visits v ON p.patient_id = v.patient_id;

❌ Why It Fails:
This returns one row per visit, not one row per patient. So patients with multiple visits appear multiple times.

✅ The Solution: Get the Most Recent Visit per Patient
You need to:

Identify each patient’s latest visit

Join only that visit record back to the patient table

✅ Correct Query (Using a Subquery):
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, v.visit_date
FROM patients p
JOIN (
    SELECT patient_id, MAX(visit_date) AS visit_date
    FROM visits
    GROUP BY patient_id
) v ON p.patient_id = v.patient_id;

✅ Alternative (Using ROW_NUMBER() if you want more visit info):
If you also want to get more columns from the visits table (e.g. reason, provider), use a window function:
WITH ranked_visits AS (
  SELECT *,
         ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY patient_id ORDER BY visit_date DESC) AS rn
  FROM visits
)
SELECT p.patient_id, p.name, v.visit_date, v.reason
FROM patients p
JOIN ranked_visits v ON p.patient_id = v.patient_id
WHERE v.rn = 1;

🧪 Result:
Each patient appears only once, with their most recent visit.

Let me know if your schema uses different column names or if you'd like to filter by visit type, date range, etc.
