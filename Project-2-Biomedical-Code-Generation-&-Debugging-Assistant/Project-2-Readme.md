# Biomedical Code Generation & Debugging Assistant
---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The **Biomedical Code Generation & Debugging Assistant** explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with biomedical data analysis and health informatics coding.  
It leverages GPT-4, Claude, and Gemini to automatically generate, debug, and explain code for common biomedical and clinical data workflows.

‚úÖ Genomics & VCF parsing  
‚úÖ RNA-seq pipelines (DESeq2)  
‚úÖ PCA of gene expression data  
‚úÖ Kaplan-Meier survival analysis  
‚úÖ SQL debugging for clinical databases

## üéØ Key Objectives

- Develop prompt engineering workflows for biomedical coding tasks.
- Compare LLM performance (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) under zero-shot and few-shot conditions.
- Build an interactive **Jupyter Notebook prototype** that transforms plain-language biomedical requests into live, executable code.
- Contribute reusable AI-assisted tools for biomedical researchers and health data scientists.

## üß† Example Tasks

- "Write Python code to calculate allele frequencies from a VCF file."
- "Perform PCA on gene expression data and plot the results."
- "Explain how RNA-seq differential expression analysis works using DESeq2."
- "Fix this R script performing a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis."
- "Diagnose and correct an SQL query returning duplicates from a patient records table."
