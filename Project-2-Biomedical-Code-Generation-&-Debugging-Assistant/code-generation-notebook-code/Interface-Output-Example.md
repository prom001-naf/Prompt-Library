# Interface-Output-Example

Of course. Here is a realistic example of the output you would see in the Jupyter Notebook after entering a task and running the cell.

Let's assume the user enters the default task into the interactive text area:

**Task:** `Find the 10 most recent publications about "GLP-1 agonists" and display the title and PubMed ID.`

After clicking the **"Generate & Run Code"** button, the output area below it would populate with the following log, showing each step of the process.
