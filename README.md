# Prompt-Library
A curated library of optimized prompts, prompt chains, and LLM output comparisons for summarization, coding, analysis, and more.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments & Credits

This project was made possible through the use of several open-source tools, APIs, and data sources that power its functionality:

### 🔍 Language Models & AI APIs

- **[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/)** — For enabling access to GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models used to generate research summaries.
- **[LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)** — Used to orchestrate prompt engineering, model chaining, and advanced summarization workflows.
- **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** — For developing an interactive frontend to test and deploy the summarization experience.
- **[Google Vertex AI / Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai)** — For integrating Google's large language models into experimental pipelines.

### 📚 File & Text Processing Libraries

- **[PyPDF2](https://pypi.org/project/PyPDF2/)** — For extracting plain text from uploaded PDF documents.
- **[python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)** *(if used)* — For managing sensitive API credentials through environment variables.

### 📄 Source Material

This tool is designed to summarize content from scientific research articles. Users are encouraged to upload content from reputable, openly accessible sources such as:
- **[PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)**
- **[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)**
- **[Genes for Good](https://genesforgood.org/)**
- Peer-reviewed journal articles (e.g., *The Lancet*, *Nature Medicine*, *JAMA*) with proper rights for reuse

*Please ensure that any uploaded material is either publicly available or used in compliance with copyright and fair-use principles.*

### 📣 Disclaimers

- This project is a student-led educational tool developed for research and public communication purposes.
- All summaries generated are based on AI output and may not be peer-reviewed or fact-checked.
- Always refer back to the original research article when making medical, scientific, or policy-related decisions.
